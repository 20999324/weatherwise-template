# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
I primarily used ChatGPT to support the development of my WeatherWise application. ChatGPT helped me explore different implementation strategies, structure my Python functions, troubleshoot errors, and refine user-facing responses. It was especially useful in generating pseudocode, improving error handling, and simplifying complex concepts like natural language parsing and API response formatting.


## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I used a variety of intentional prompting strategies throughout the project:

I rephrased the problem in my own words to ensure understanding before asking for help.

I requested pseudocode before asking for final implementations.

I challenged edge cases, such as invalid city inputs or broken JSON responses.

I asked for code explanations to understand why specific solutions worked.

I used iterative refinement, asking for improvements on initial code to make it more modular and readable.

## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
I’m proud of how well I integrated the conversational AI interface with data visualisation and live weather API access. The app feels intuitive and dynamic — users can ask a natural-sounding question like "Will it rain in Melbourne tomorrow?" and get a real, relevant answer. The clarity of my visualisation functions and the structure of my final notebook also turned out better than expected.



## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I would implement caching and logging for repeated city queries. This would reduce API calls and help track user history. I would also improve the natural language parser to handle more diverse phrasing and perhaps add synonyms or fuzzy matching using libraries like fuzzywuzzy or spaCy.

## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
This project helped me build confidence in breaking down complex problems and working with external APIs. More importantly, I developed a better understanding of how to collaborate with AI as a tool — not just to generate code, but to guide it thoughtfully and refine it critically. It was incredibly rewarding to finish with a fully functioning and interactive Python application that reflects both technical skill and creative decision-making.
