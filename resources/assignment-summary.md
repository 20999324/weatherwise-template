# WeatherWise: What's This Project All About?

## The Big Picture

You'll build a weather app called "Weather Advisor" that combines real weather data with AI conversation abilities. Think of it as a smart weather assistant that can answer questions like "Should I take an umbrella tomorrow?" or "What's the temperature going to be like this weekend in Sydney?"

## What You'll Create

This project has two main parts:

1. **Weather Information Display**
   - Gets current weather and forecasts for any location
   - Shows useful charts and graphs of temperature and rain chances
   - Presents weather data in a clear, organised way

2. **Conversation Feature**
   - Lets users ask questions in everyday language
   - Understands what weather information they need
   - Responds in a natural, helpful way

## How You'll Build It

You'll:
- Write Python code to get weather data from online services
- Create visual charts to show weather patterns
- Build a user-friendly menu system
- Program the app to understand weather questions
- Use AI tools to help with coding challenges
- Document how you used AI to solve problems

## Learning Value

This project helps you learn:
- How to build a complete, working application
- Creating useful data visualisations
- Making intuitive user interfaces
- Working effectively with AI coding assistants
- Using version control (GitHub)
- Writing well-structured, maintainable code

## Assessment Approach

You'll be graded on:
- Whether your app works as expected (20%)
- Quality of your code (15%)
- How well you organised your work (10%)
- How easy your app is to use (10%)
- How effectively you used AI tools (25%)
- Quality of your AI interactions (10%)
- Technical implementation choices (10%)

## Why This Project Matters

This assignment gives you practical experience creating a useful application while learning to work effectively with AI tools. It's designed to be challenging but achievable, bringing together many skills you've learnt throughout the course. The focus isn't just on the final product, but on your journey of development and problem-solving.

By the end, you'll have created something practical that demonstrates your programming abilities and your skill in directing AI tools to achieve specific goals - an increasingly important skill in today's technology landscape.
