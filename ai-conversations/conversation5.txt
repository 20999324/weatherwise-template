Me:
I asked for a menu using pyinputplus and the AI gave me a version that didn’t loop — it just ran once and ended. I need a version that keeps looping until “Exit” is chosen.

AI:
That’s a good catch. You need a while True: loop with an inputMenu() inside it. Here’s the fixed version:

python
Copy
Edit
def main_menu():
    import pyinputplus as pyip
    while True:
        choice = pyip.inputMenu(['Ask a Weather Question', 'Show Temperature Chart', 'Show Precipitation Chart', 'Exit'],
                                numbered=True, prompt="\nWhat would you like to do?\n")
        if choice == 'Ask a Weather Question':
            ask_weather_question()
        elif choice == 'Show Temperature Chart':
            ...
        elif choice == 'Show Precipitation Chart':
            ...
        elif choice == 'Exit':
            print("Goodbye!")
            break
Me:
Much better. Now it loops properly. I’ll plug in my functions inside each branch.
